    bio: `The early years (2003â€“2005) saw him as a ring trader at a local broker, marked by relentless
efforts to chase market tips and the pursuit of quick profits. Losses were frequent, but they
laid the foundation for understanding what not to do.
Inspired by setbacks and failures, he taught himself everything necessary to make sense of
the puzzle. A disciplined approach emerged, allowing him to navigate the turbulence of the
2008 global bear market with a net short portfolio.
Between 2009 and 2012, curiosity led him to explore programming, enabling him to
transition into systematic trading. This shift allowed him to develop and implement
strategies across global currency and commodity markets.By 2016, his journey expanded into statistical arbitrage, diving deep into data and
mathematics to achieve consistency and a higher Sharpe ratio.`,
